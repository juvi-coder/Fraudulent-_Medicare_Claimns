# Healthcare Fraud: An Unseen Epidemic Impacting Medicare's Effectiveness

# Problem Statement
Healthcare fraud is a persistent issue in the US, with certain providers exploiting Medicare for personal gain. This problem limits Medicare's capacity to serve the healthcare needs of elderly and other qualifying individuals effectively.
Despite efforts by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to minimize fraudulent activities, identifying patterns of fraudulent claims remains a challenge.

# Objective
Our goal is to examine patterns of fraudulent claims activity in the CMS Medicare dataset, using the list of fraudulent providers from LEIE.
We aim to identify specific features distinguishing fraudulent physicians from non-fraudulent ones and develop a classifier model for fraud detection.

# Significance
Addressing healthcare fraud is vital for the equitable distribution of Medicare resources, ensuring maximum reach and effectiveness of the program.
By leveraging data analysis and machine learning, we can proactively identify potential fraud cases, thus preserving resources for those truly in need.


Medicare fraud and abuse can occur everywhere, increasing everyone's taxes and health care expenditures. Many instances include: 

A healthcare professional charges Medicare for goods or services you never received, such as billing you for a visit or a back brace you never received. 
A provider who bills Medicare twice for a good or service you only received once. 
A person who uses your Medicare card or number to submit false claims on your behalf. 
A business that proposes a Medicare drug plan to you that Medicare hasn't approved.

CMS has released  datasets, including the Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data: Physician and Other Supplier.

The Office of the Inspector General provides a dataset of List of Excluded Individuals and Entities (LEIE), signifying fraudulent providers.

**Using the above two datasets, levraging the power of Altreyx, Tableau and Python, **I have built an Gradient Boosted Model, with 76% Accuracy and 71% AUC Scores.**

**I have attached my presentation deck, altreyx flows, Tableau BI Solution and Python code for the problem. ****
